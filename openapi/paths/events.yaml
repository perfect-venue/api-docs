  description: >
    Creates a new event in a venue. 


    Creating an event requires a `venue_id`. You can get a list of the current user's venues
    by calling the [list venues](/#tag/Venues/operation/listVenues) endpoint.  


    Creating an event also requires a `contact_id`. When you create a contact via the [create contact](/#tag/Contacts/operation/createContact)
    endpoint, you will get back a unique identifier for the contact that can be used to create events.
